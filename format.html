        Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way that a page is displayed. <br> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation. <p> Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear </p> in a printed document.
